# Serverless-ETL-Services
The Intelligent Serverless ETL Pipeline with Gen AI Integration project aims to revolutionize the traditional ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process by combining serverless computing architecture with Generative AI capabilities. This solution provides a scalable, cost-efficient, and intelligent data pipeline that automates the entire data flow — from extraction to storage — while offering advanced features like anomaly detection, data summarization, and adaptive workflows.
